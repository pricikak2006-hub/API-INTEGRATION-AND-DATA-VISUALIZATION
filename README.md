Working on the topic of API Integration and Data Visualization was a valuable and practical learning experience. This experiment helped in understanding how real-time data can be fetched

from external sources using public APIs and processed using Python. By integrating the OpenWeatherMap API, I learned how to send HTTP requests, handle API keys securely, and receive 

responses in JSON format. Parsing the JSON data and extracting required fields such as temperature and humidity improved my understanding of data structures and real-world data handling.

Using the Pandas library to organize the data into a DataFrame made data manipulation easier and more efficient. I gained hands-on experience in cleaning and structuring data before 

visualization. Implementing data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn helped me understand how graphical representations make data more meaningful and easy to analyze. Creating 

line charts for temperature and humidity trends allowed me to observe weather patterns over time clearly.

During the implementation, I faced minor challenges such as API errors, incorrect city names, and handling large datasets. Debugging these issues improved my problem-solving skills and 

familiarity with error handling in Python. This experiment also enhanced my confidence in integrating third-party services into applications.

Overall, this experience provided practical exposure to real-world data processing and visualization techniques. It strengthened my understanding of Python libraries, API communication, 

and dashboard creation. The knowledge gained from this topic is highly useful for future projects in data analytics, web applications, and real-time monitoring systems.
